# ml-notebooks

Some notebooks on ML framework (PyTorch and TF) APIs, esp. deep learning related ones.
I am trying to write them in style of tutorials and with focus on helping
programmers to use them effectively rather than its underlying theory.

As a programmer, **I like types and assertions** thus I will try to
present the knowledge this way in code.
And yes, I don't like other people's doc and tutorials on them.
